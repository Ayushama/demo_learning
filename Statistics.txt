Essentials of Statistics and Math for Data Science
 :- Statistics:

Descriptive Statistics:

Mean: The average value of a dataset.
Median: The middle value of a dataset when arranged in order.
Mode: The most frequently occurring value in a dataset.
Variance: A measure of how data points vary from the mean.
Standard Deviation: A measure of the spread or dispersion of data points.
Inferential Statistics:

Hypothesis Testing: The process of making decisions or inferences about a population based on sample data. This includes null and alternative hypotheses, p-values, and significance levels.
Confidence Intervals: A range of values that is likely to contain the true population parameter with a specified level of confidence.
Probability:

Probability Basics: Understand probability as a measure of uncertainty and events.
Probability Distributions: Familiarize yourself with common distributions like the normal distribution.
Bayes' Theorem: A fundamental concept for conditional probability and Bayesian statistics.
Sampling:

Random Sampling: Ensure samples are representative by using random sampling techniques.
Stratified Sampling: Divide the population into strata and sample from each stratum.
Regression Analysis:

Linear Regression: Learn how to model linear relationships between variables.
Logistic Regression: Used for binary classification problems.
Statistical Testing:

t-tests: Used to compare means of two groups.
Chi-Square Tests: Used for categorical data analysis.
ANOVA: Analysis of variance for comparing means of more than two groups.
Resampling Techniques:

Bootstrapping: Repeatedly resample from your data to estimate statistics and make inferences.
Cross-Validation: Divide your data into subsets for model evaluation.
Mathematics:

Linear Algebra:

Matrices and Vectors: Understand matrix operations (addition, multiplication, transpose) and vector spaces.
Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors: Important for dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
Calculus:

Differentiation: Understand how to find derivatives, which is crucial for optimization algorithms in machine learning.
Integration: Understand the concept of integration, which has applications in probability and statistics.
Probability and Statistics:

Probability Distributions: Study common probability distributions (e.g., normal, binomial, Poisson).
Statistical Concepts: Understand concepts like expected value, variance, and covariance.
Optimization:

Gradient Descent: Learn how gradient descent is used for optimizing machine learning models.
Numerical Analysis:

Root Finding: Methods for finding roots of equations, which is used in various algorithms.
Information Theory:

Entropy: Understand the concept of entropy in information theory, which is used in decision trees and information gain.
Graph Theory:

Graph Representation: Learn how to represent data and relationships using graphs.
Graph Algorithms: Understand algorithms for traversing and analyzing graphs.
Linear Programming:

Optimization Problems: Learn how to formulate and solve linear programming problems.
Remember that learning these topics can be a gradual process, and practice with real data and projects is essential to reinforce your understanding. Additionally, there are many online courses and textbooks available that dive deeper into these subjects, tailored specifically for data science and machine learning.s
